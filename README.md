**`Data Analyst | Data Engineer | Supply Chain`**

I'm a data analyst and data engineer within the supply chain space building my understanding of data and how to drive value for organizations and the teams that run them. I strive to implement proper data pipelines that enable analyst and business leaders to gain insight into their decisions and the impact they have over time. Working with data always provides unique and complex challenges to solve, which I try to write about on my personal blog site [here](https://www.sergiopuno.com/).

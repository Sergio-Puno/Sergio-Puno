### Welcome to my repo!

Hi I'm Sergio, I'm data analyst working in supply chain and logistics. I mainly work with SQL, R, and PowerBI for dashboards while looking to improve my machine learning and probabilistic modeling to enchance my demand forecasting skills. I post some of my analysis here with the source code and typically will work in R markdown or a Jupyter notebook if working with Python to help people follow along with my analysis.
